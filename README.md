# George Washington Neural Network
This repository contains a neural network library built from scratch for use in Neural Network courses at
The George Washington University. It is a basic implementation that provides a number of layers, activation
functions, and loss functions for students to explore how networks work at a low level.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Functionality
The branch "convolutional-neuralnet-so" is an extension of the GWU neural network library with the added cnn functionality implemented by [@shivaomrani](https://github.com/shivaomrani). The neural network functionality is tested on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. You can run the following command to test CNN:

```
python cnn.py
```

### Temporary Comment
The implementation is not completed yet. I have now the general skeleton of the CNN functionality for project deliverable II.
