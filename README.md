# George Washington Neural Network
This repository contains a neural network library built from scratch for use in Neural Network courses at
The George Washington University. It is a basic implementation that provides a number of layers, activation
functions, and loss functions for students to explore how networks work at a low level.

# Convolutional Neural Network
As the final project for the course, the standard GWU NN library will be extended to provide support for
convolutional neural networks. (Implementation of such in this branch is by Grant McClearn.)
